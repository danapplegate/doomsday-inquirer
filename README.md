Doomsday Inquirer
=================

Website and class materials for _From HTML to PHP: Creating Dynamic Pages
(Despite Doomsday)_

Class Description
-----------------

If markup languages like HTML make up the body of a website, then programming
languages like PHP give it life, allowing it to interact with your visitors and
respond with content created just for them. Dynamic web sites are what make the
internet the amazing place that it is, and each one of them has at its core a
programming language working behind the scenes. With nearly 25 million sites
currently running it, PHP is a popular choice, and although it's relatively
easy to make the leap from writing static HTML to dynamic pages, the PHP
language is still powerful and flexible enough to build the most monstrous of
sites.

In this class, we'll take our knowledge of HTML and incrementally build up to
creating dynamic pages which interact with our users. Along the way, we'll
cover the following topics:
*   What makes a web page dynamic
*   How does the web server deal with dynamic pages
*   Using basic PHP utility functions such as `echo` and `date`
*   PHP variables and how they can help maintain a site
*   Using arrays, loops and functions to help us write repetitive markup
*   Understanding the special POST and GET variables and how to use web forms
    and the query string to allow our site to respond to user input
*   Organizing our site into different files using `include`
*   How a dynamic web site uses a database to accumulate content over time (We
    won't get into the complex topic of database programming, but students who
    have taken Dan Kozikowski's [Introduction to SQL class]
    (http://www.skillshare.com/Get-the-Data-For-Yourself-An-Introduction-to-SQL/1014651684/219879240)
    or another beginner database class will be able to connect what they
    learned there with our own work) 
    
By the end of the two hour class, you'll be able to use these fundamental
building blocks to create simple web applications like blogs and contact forms.
You can finally cross "Build an awesome website" off your bucket list.

And just in time, too! As we progress through the class, we'll apply what we
learn to "The Doomsday Inquirer", a simple news site that aims to provide a
one-stop experience for every doomsday prepper's need to feel ahead of the
pack. Ancient Mayan calendars, accelerating global warming, 2009's blockbuster
documentary film _2012_ -- all signs point to an apocalypse before the year is
out! With such a short timeline (until December 21st, to be exact), we'll need
every tool PHP provides at our disposal to engage our users and keep the site updated with the
latest end times info.

The class will last 2 hours, with short sections of lecture broken up by quick
bursts of hands-on experience where you'll apply what you've just learned and
ask any questions you might have. I'll make the source code for the site
available to you, both at the initial state and at various checkpoints through the
class, so you'll be able to keep up as we move quickly from topic to topic. If
you've used git or have taken Eric's [Learn to use
Git](http://www.skillshare.com/Learn-to-use-Git/1970475139/1026796267) class,
you'll be able to practice those skills jumping from state to state.  

Prerequisites
-------------

You should have an understanding of HTML. Even better if you've had experience
writing it. CSS knowledge is not required, but you'll be able to customize the
look of the simple site we'll be working with. If you've taken a class like
Reece's [Building Websites
101](http://www.skillshare.com/Building-Websites-101-Basic-HTML-CSS/1658979046/1318357438),
you're golden. You'll also need to bring a laptop with a capable text editor
like Text Wrangler or Sublime -- I'll send out a prep document showing you how
to set up your very own web server on it, so we can dive right in and cover as
much ground as possible.

Teacher Credentials

Dan Applegate is an engineer at Skillshare. Although he has always loved
computers and taught himself to program in his pre-teen years, Dan spent an
equal amount of time acting in school and community theatre productions. After
graduating _magna cum laude_ from Wake Forest University with degrees in
Theatre and Computer Science, he spent 9 months as an acting apprentice at the
Actors Theatre of Louisville, before moving to New York in 2010. Prior to
working with the Skillshare team to help democratize education, Dan worked as a
web developer at the award-winning digital agency
[Rokkan](http://www.rokkan.com), building highly interactive and dynamic sites
such as [Ford Escape Routes](http://www.escaperoutes.com).
