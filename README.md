Doomsday Inquirer
=================

Website and class materials for _From Markup to Code: Creating Dynamic Pages
(Despite Doomsday)_

Class Description
-----------------

If markup languages like HTML make up the body of a website, then programming
languages like PHP give it life, allowing it to interact with your visitors and
respond with content just for them. Dynamic web sites are what make the internet
the amazing place that it is, and each one of them has at its core a
programming language working behind the scenes. With nearly 25 million sites currently
running, PHP is a popular choice, and although it's relatively easy to make 
the leap from writing markup to writing PHP, the language is still powerful and flexible enough
to build the most monstrous of sites. Mark Zuckerberg wrote Facebook in PHP in
his dormroom, and even our very own Skillshare.com is built with it -- currently
with over 330k lines of PHP alone!

In this class, we'll take our knowledge of HTML and incrementally build up to
dynamic pages interacting with a basic database. Along the way, we'll cover the
following topics:
*   What makes a web page dynamic
*   How does the web server deal with dynamic pages
*   Using basic PHP utility functions such as `echo` and `date`
*   PHP variables and how they can help maintain a site
*   Using arrays, loops and functions to help us write repetitive markup
*   Organizing our site into different files using `include`
*   Retrieving and outputting data from an SQL database (We won't get into the 
    complex topic of database programming, but students who have taken Dan Kozikowski's 
    [Introduction to SQL class](http://www.skillshare.com/Get-the-Data-For-Yourself-An-Introduction-to-SQL/1014651684/219879240)
    or another beginner database class will be able to connect what they learned there 
    with our own work)
*   If we have time, we'll touch on receiving input from the user through HTML
    forms and storing that input into the database, to be displayed later
By the end of the two hour class, you'll be able liven up your own
markup with dynamic content and understand PHP well enough to cross
"Learn a programming language" off your bucket list.

And just in time, too! Ancient Mayan calendars, accelerating global warming, 
2009's blockbuster documentary film _2012_ -- all signs point to an apocalypse
before the year is out! Yet, even amidst the confusion and humanity of impending
doom, leave it to our client to find a way to try and turn a buck. As we progress
through the class, we'll apply what we learn to "The Doomsday Inquirer", a simple
news site that aims to provide a one-stop experience for every doomsday
prepper's need to feel ahead of the pack. With such a short timeline (until
December 21st, to be exact), we'll need every tool PHP provides at our disposal
to keep the site updated with the latest end times info.

With any luck, we'll come out on the other side of the end of the world with a
hands-on, solid foundation of dynamic web programming from which to build the 
Facebook of the new Earth! Hey, even mutant zombies need a way to "like"
pictures of their friends' 5-legged cats...

Prerequisites
-------------

You should have an understanding of HTML. Even better if you've had
experience writing it. CSS knowledge is not required, but you'll be able to
customize the look of the simple site we'll be working with. If you've taken a
class like Reece's [Building Websites 101](http://www.skillshare.com/Building-Websites-101-Basic-HTML-CSS/1658979046/1318357438),
you're golden. If you've used git or have taken Eric's [Learn to use
Git](http://www.skillshare.com/Learn-to-use-Git/1970475139/1026796267) class,
you'll be able to access the official code at each step we take. You'll also
need to bring a laptop with a capable text editor like Text Wrangler or Sublime -- I'll 
send out a prep document showing you how to set up your very own web server on 
it, so we can dive right in and cover as much ground as possible.

Teacher Credentials
-------------------

Dan Applegate is an engineer at Skillshare. Although he has always loved
computers and taught himself to program in his pre-teen years, Dan spent an
equal amount of time acting in school and community theatre productions. After
graduating _magna cum laude_ from Wake Forest University with degrees in Theatre
and Computer Science, he spent 9 months as an acting apprentice at the Actors
Theatre of Louisville, before moving to New York in 2010. Prior to working with
the Skillshare team to help democratize education, Dan worked as a web developer
at the award-winning digital agency [Rokkan](http://www.rokkan.com), building highly interactive and
dynamic sites such as [Ford Escape Routes](http://www.escaperoutes.com).
